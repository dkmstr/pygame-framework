# pygame-framework
This is an experiment i did a long ago with pygame, to test with different options, using tiled as editor.

It works, you can try it executing "nivelin.py".

It contains lots of elements, such as bsp trees for collision detection, automated paths for sprites, triggers, ...

My something can help someone :)

Feel free to take whatever you want.
